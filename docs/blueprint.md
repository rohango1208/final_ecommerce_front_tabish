- Background color: Light beige (#F8F8F2), a very desaturated tint of the primary hue, creating a calm and sophisticated canvas.
- Accent color: Light green (#A8E6A1), analogous to the primary color, yet bright enough to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Headings font: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings, size 3rem+, letter spacing 0.5px, and line height 1.2.
- Body UI font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, readable interface.
- Use simple, elegant icons for navigation, search, cart, and wishlist.
- Apply subtle fade-in animations for sections on scroll and page load, using AOS, Framer Motion, or CSS @keyframes.
- Implement zoom-in effects, smooth alternate image fades, and soft card shadow elevations on product card hovers.
- Incorporate hover transitions such as a slight scale and drop shadow on buttons for enhanced interaction.
